    detailedDescription: `
  This Cheat Engine project reverse-engineers Ninja Gaiden 2 Black on PC to analyze game mechanics like health and combos, using assembly for modifications.
  
  ### Capabilities
  
  - Implements auto guard, infinite HP, massive damage, and shop mods via AOB scanning and code injection.
  
  ### Technical Details
  
  - Uses assembly (*jmp*, *nop*) and conditional jumps (*jne*, *je*) for dynamic changes.
  - Organized with enable/disable blocks and symbol management.
  
  ### Outcomes
  
  Enhances reverse engineering and assembly skills, applicable to game development and security, with a focus on deconstructing complex systems.
