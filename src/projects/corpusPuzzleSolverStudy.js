    detailedDescription: `
  This AutoIt script studies Corpus puzzles in Warframe by analyzing pixel colors to determine states and calculate solutions, showcasing automation and problem-solving skills.
  
  ### How it Works
  - Uses PixelGetColor to detect puzzle states from test.txt coordinates, solving with minimal clicks via logic comparisons.
  
  ### Key Skills
  - **Automation:** Streamlines repetitive task analysis.
  - **Problem Solving:** Translates logic into code.
  - **Pixel Analysis:** Detects states with precision.
  - **System Interaction:** Integrates external data and hotkeys.
  
  A solid example of logical coding and system interaction for technical exploration.
