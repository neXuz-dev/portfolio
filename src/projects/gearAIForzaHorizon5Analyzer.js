    detailedDescription: `
  GearAI is a sophisticated AutoIt tool designed to analyze gear shifting in Forza Horizon 5, demonstrating deep understanding of low-level system interaction, memory manipulation, and real-time data processing, aimed at mastering these concepts.
  
  ### Key Technologies & Concepts
  
  - **Process Interaction:** Identifies *ForzaHorizon5.exe* and retrieves module base addresses.
  - **Memory Reading & Writing:** Uses custom *KDMemory* library to monitor speed and gear.
  - **Dynamic Analysis:** Configurable shift points via *config.ini* for adaptability.
  - **GUI:** Provides real-time feedback and car profile selection.
  - **Hotkeys:** *PAUSE* and *HOME* keys control operation.
  
  ### How It Works
  
  - Loads *config.ini*, sets up GUI, monitors process, analyzes data, and updates UI in real-time.
  
  ### Why This Matters
  
  - **Reverse Engineering:** Identifies memory locations for data analysis.
  - **System-Level:** Direct memory and process interaction.
  - **Algorithmic Thinking:** Designs gear shift logic.
  - **Professionalism:** Compiled as a standalone executable.
  
  A strong example of core programming principles and technical learning applied practically.
