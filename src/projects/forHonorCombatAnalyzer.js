    detailedDescription: `
  This project creates a smart AutoIt tool to analyze combat patterns in For Honor using image recognition, focusing on technical skills like image processing and real-time system interaction for learning purposes.
  
  ### Key Features & Skills
  
  - **Image Recognition:** Uses *FastFind64.dll* for robust attack detection.
  - **Real-time Response:** Monitors screen and reacts with precise timing (15ms delays).
  - **Modular Design:** Configurable via INI files for character-specific settings.
  - **Complex Logic:** Tracks combat states (*CurrentGuardSide*, *EnemyIsAttacking*) for pattern analysis.
  - **Resource Management:** Manages external DLL and icon resources with error handling.
  
  ### Summary
  
  Demonstrates image processing, real-time interaction, and modular design, applicable to broader automation and analysis tasks, with a focus on technical development.
