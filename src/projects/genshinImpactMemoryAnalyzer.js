    detailedDescription: `
  This project applies reverse engineering to Genshin Impact using Cheat Engine and assembly, focusing on understanding memory manipulation and game mechanics at a low level for learning purposes.
  
  ### Key Skills
  
  - **Reverse Engineering:** Uses AOB scanning and code injection for memory modifications.
  - **Assembly:** Manipulates registers (*rcx*, *rdx*, *r8*) and uses instructions (*mov*, *jmp*, *cmp*) for logic.
  - **Features:** Explores infinite stamina, no cooldowns, speed hacks, and godmode through memory edits.
  
  ### Project Structure
  
  - Modular cheat blocks with enable/disable functionality.
  - Symbol management with *registersymbol*/*unregistersymbol*.
  
  ### Outcome
  
  Improves reverse engineering and assembly skills, applicable to security, game development, and system optimization, with a methodical approach to complex systems.
