    detailedDescription: `
  This project demonstrates proficiency in C++, Windows API programming, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) by creating a utility to analyze a specific in-game task within Sea of Thieves. The "Sloop Auto-Sail" tool studies ship heading maintenance, focusing on technical experience rather than gameplay alteration.
  
  ### Functionality
  
  - **Screen Capture:** Captures a predefined compass region.
  - **OCR Processing:** Uses Tesseract OCR to extract numerical heading values.
  - **Input Simulation:** Simulates ‘Q’ or ‘D’ key presses to study heading adjustments.
  - **Hotkey Activation:** Toggleable with *Ctrl + Alt + J* for usability.
  - **Invisible UI:** Runs as a background process.
  
  ### Key Technologies & Skills
  
  - **C++:** Core language for robust implementation.
  - **Windows API:** Handles *keybd_event*, *RegisterHotKey*, and screen capture.
  - **Tesseract OCR:** Integrates open-source OCR for data extraction.
  - **Image Processing:** Manages bitmap data for OCR input.
  
  ### Why This Project Matters
  
  It showcases a strong foundation in C++ and Windows API, with practical application of Tesseract OCR to solve real-world problems. The design emphasizes precision and technical skill, applicable to broader software development roles beyond gaming contexts.
